//Exercise 7: Method Overloading â€“ Adding Integers and Doubles
//Task:
//Overload a method named addValues that adds two integers in one version and two doubles in another.
// Call both versions and print the results.
//Expected Output:
//Two outputs: one with the sum of integers, and the other with the sum of doubles.
