//Exercise 2: Writing and Evaluating Expressions
//Task:
//Write a program that declares four integer variables, performs an arithmetic operation (addition or multiplication), and prints the result.
//Expected Output:
//The result of the arithmetic operation.

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num1 = 10;
        int num2 = 20;
        int num3 = 30;
        int num4 = 40;

        int addition = num1 + num2 + num3 + num4;

        System.out.println("The result of the arithmetic operation is = " + addition);
    }
}
