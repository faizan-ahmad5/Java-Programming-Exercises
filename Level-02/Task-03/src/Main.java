//Exercise 3: Understanding Code Blocks and Indentation
//Task:
//Write a program where you include a simple if-else block to check whether a number is
//positive or negative. Ensure proper indentation for clarity.
//Expected Output:
//The program will print whether the number is positive or negative.

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 5;

        if (num > 0) {
            System.out.println("The number is positive");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The number is negative");
        }
    }
}
