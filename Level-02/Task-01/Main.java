//Exercise 1: Identifying Java Keywords
//Task:
//Identify all the keywords used in the following Java program and explain the purpose of each keyword.

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 5;
        if (number > 3) {
            System.out.println("The number is greater than 3");
        }
    }
}

//------- ANSWER HERE ---------
// public is a keyword that means the class or method can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
// class is a keyword that defines a blueprint for creating objects. Multiple objects can be created from a class.
// static is a keyword that makes a method or variable belong to the class itself, so it
// can be used without creating an object of the class.
// void is a keyword that indicates the method does not return any value.
// int is a keyword used to define a variable that holds whole numbers (integers).
// if is a keyword used to check a condition, and if it's true, the code inside the {} will be executed.
